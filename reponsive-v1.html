                        <p>The Khmer Empire was a powerful state in South East
                            Asia, formed by people of the same name, lasting
                            from 802 CE to 1431 CE. At its peak, the empire
                            covered much of what today is Cambodia, Thailand,
                            Laos, and southern Vietnam.By the 7th century CE,
                            Khmer people inhabited territories along the Mekong
                            river -the world's seventh longest river - from the
                            delta to roughly the modern Cambodia-Laos border,
                            plus the region between that river and the great
                            Tonle Sap lake to the west and the area running
                            along the Tonle Sap river (which runs from the lake
                            to the sea, joining the Mekong in the delta). There
                            were several kingdoms at constant war against each
                            other, with art and culture heavily influenced by
                            India due to long established sea trade routes with
                            that subcontinent.</p>
